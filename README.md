## üìå Project Overview (EN)

**BeatStore** is a modern web platform inspired by BeatStars, designed to buy and sell music beats. The project is built using microservice architecture to ensure scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features:

#### üåê `api-gateway-web`:
- Centralized routing using Spring Cloud Gateway (WebFlux)

- Reactive stack with Spring WebFlux

- Routes for microservices defined in application.properties

- Route forwarding with path rewriting using RewritePath

- CORS configuration allowing cross-origin requests from the frontend (to be restricted later)

- CSRF protection enabled (important due to use of JWT in HttpOnly cookies)

- Eureka client integration for service discovery (lb://SERVICE-NAME URI)
  
- Per-request JWT verification using RSA256 public key in API Gateway for secure authentication

#### üåç `discovery-server`:
- Centralized service registry using Netflix Eureka
- Central point where all microservices (user-service, marketplace-service, ‚Ä¶) register themselves
- Enables dynamic service discovery (no need to hardcode URLs between services)
- Provides a web dashboard at http://localhost:8761
 to monitor registered instances

#### üîê `user-service`:
- User registration and login
- Google OAuth2 authentication
- JWT authentication (access and refresh tokens)
- RSA256 signing for JWT

#### üõí `marketplace-service`:
- Beat file upload (MP3, WAV, STEMS)
- Adding beat licenses
- (Upcoming) Real-time playback tracking ‚Äî Redis and Kafka will be used to handle high-throughput ‚Äúbeat played‚Äù events for real-time listener and popularity stats.
- (Upcoming) Short-term data analytics ‚Äî MongoDB will store detailed play events (user, country, timestamp) for flexible querying and 7‚Äì30 day trend analysis.
- (Upcoming) Long-term reporting ‚Äî Aggregated statistics (daily/weekly plays, unique listeners, etc.) will be periodically transferred to PostgreSQL for historical insights and producer reports.

### üõ†Ô∏è Upcoming Features:
- Separate authentication from user management ‚Äî The current user-service handles both user data and authentication logic (JWT, login, etc.). This will be split into two independent microservices to follow proper domain boundaries and improve scalability.
- auth-service will handle authentication, JWT/refresh tokens, OAuth2 login, and role management. user-service will manage user profiles, public information, and relationships (followers, subscriptions, etc.).
- Session implementation for storing `userHash`, `subscriptionHash`, etc.
- Support for `applyToAllBeats` to assign licenses to all beats on creation
- New `subscriptions` microservice for managing monthly billing and paid plans
- `role-permission` microservice with fine-grained access control via `@PreAuthorize`
- Additional marketplace features: beat editing, license purchases, search functionality
- Implement proper security headers to protect against XSS (e.g., Content-Security-Policy)
- Add CSRF protection using techniques
- Introduce an API Gateway layer to centralize authentication and authorization logic, ensuring that only authorized requests reach downstream services
- Configure the gateway to perform pre-filtering of incoming requests
- Add JWT signature verification for every request that requires authorization
- Add RequestContext extraction from JWT per request
- Add Redis-based JWT blacklist: Store invalidated JWTs in Redis with TTL matching token expiry. On each request, reject tokens found in the blacklist.
- Implement OpenAPI-Based API Contracts
  - Introduce **contract-first communication** across all microservices (`auth-service`, `user-service`, `marketplace-service`, etc.) using **OpenAPI 3**  
  - Automatically **generate and publish** `openapi.yaml` specs for each service, then use **OpenAPI Generator** to create clients and DTOs from those contracts  
  - Add **API versioning and CI/CD validation** to detect and prevent breaking changes between microservice APIs
- Extend `ContentVisibility` enum with a new status (e.g. `COPYRIGHT_CLAIMED`)  
  - Used when a copyright infringement claim is filed against a beat  
  - Beats with this status should be **hidden from all users**, including the author, until the claim is resolved  
  - Only **admins** can view and manage content under this status
